            I'm just a young developer with a passion for creation! Since my childhood, I've always been interested in
            what's going on behind the scenes of video games, computers, and of course, websites! After making my first
            "game" in <a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Batch%20File&cad=h" target="_blank">Batch</a> at the age
            of twelve I've been coding ever since. For the past few years I've fiddled with markup languages like HTML &
            CSS, worked in frameworks like <a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=The%20Bootstrap%20Framework"
                target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, learned languages like <a class="link"
                href="https://www.google.com/search?q=JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> and libraries like <a class="link"
                href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jQuery" target="_blank">jQuery</a> all alongside experimenting
            with many other different languages and frameworks which have helped me do things I never thought I could
            ever do by myself. This website is a place for me to showcase the work I've done over the years, giving you
            a sneak peak at everything I've accomplished as a developer! When I'm not being a developer, I'm usually either
            playing video games, hanging with friends, or on a good day, going out to eat, which is one of my favorite
            things to do!
